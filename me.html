    <h1>Nick P.</h1>
    <p>My hope in taking this class is to learn a bit more about the core web technologies.  Especially goal is to improve my CSS skills </p> 

    <p>
        I am currently a quant dev lead at a multi asset hedgefund based in NY.  Prior to that I was a delivery manager at HSBC leading a 
        team of 15 devs building out HSBCs client facing FX trading platform.  
        
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a full stack dev by trait working with Python, kdb+/q, sql on the server side / data layer and Javascript, Node, React, HTML, CSS
        on the front end.  I use primarily Nextjs framework and material UI to build out necessary analytics dashboards which means that lot of the 
        more complex CSS are abstracted away from me.  I only tend to use basic CSS, especially in line on a daily basis.  So hope is to 
        improve on that.
